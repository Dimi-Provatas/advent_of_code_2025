# [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

All challenges solved with no external crates, only using `std`.

## Solutions

Average runtime for all 12 days:

- Debug: 5 seconds
- Release: 0.85 seconds

## new_day.sh

A simple script to create all the boilerplate code for a new day.
Can be used as:

```sh
./new_day.sh day123
```

This will create all folders and files needed for a new day.
I will also add the needed lines in main.rs.
